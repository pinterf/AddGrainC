** AddGrainC **
Random noise film grain generator for Avisynth+ and Avisynth 2.6
Copyright (C) 2003 Tom Barry et al

AddGrain generates film like grain or other effects (like rain) by adding
random noise to a video clip.  This noise may optionally be horizontally 
or vertically correlated to cause streaking.

  AddGrain  ( float var, float hcorr, float vcorr, float uvar, int seed, bool constant, bool sse2 )

Requirements
==================

* AviSynth+ or AviSynth 2.6
* Y, planar YUV(A), planar RGB(A) video formats, RGB24/32/48/64

Parameters
==================

var (1.0), uvar (0.0)
  The standard deviation (strength) of the luma and chroma noise, 0 is disabled.
  uvar does nothing in Y-only or RGB mode.

hcorr (0.0), vcorr (0.0)
  Horizontal and vertical correlation, which causes a nifty streaking effect.
  Range 0.0-1.0

seed (-1)
  Specifies a repeatable grain sequence. Set to at least 0 to use.

constant (false)
  Specifies a constant grain pattern on every frame.

sse2 (true)
  debug parameter, set to false for C routines


AddGrain alias is left to retain compatibility with existing scripts using it.

The correlation factors are actually just implemented as exponential smoothing
which give a weird side affect that I did not attempt to adjust.  But this means
that as you increase either corr factor you will have to also increase the stddev
(grain amount) in order to get the same visible amount of grain, since it is being 
smooth out a bit.

Increase both corr factors can somewhat give clumps, or larger grain size. 

And there is an interesting effect with, say, AddGrain(800,0,.9) or any huge amount 
of strongly vertical grain.  It can make a scene look like it is raining.

?       2014-2018    HolyWu       VapourSynth port: https://github.com/HomeOfVapourSynthEvolution/VapourSynth-AddGrain
?       2019         StvG         Backport to Avisynth+
                                  Changes to 1.7.1:
                                  Support Avisynth+ high bit depth
                                  Register Avisynth+ MT mode as MT_MULTI_INSTANCE
                                  Addgrain parameter order made similar to AddGrainC: 
                                     var, uvar, hcorr, vcorr, seed, constant (was: var, hcorr, vcorr, uvar, seed, constant)
                                  Removed bool "sse2" parameter
                                  Name is Addgrain
                                  Removed SIMD optimization
1.8     2020/04/09   pinterf      Plugin name changed back to AddGrainC
                                  Fix output darkening (regression in VS port)
                                  Add back documentation, credits
                                  Add back SIMD optimization (SSE2, SSE4)
                                  Add back version resource
1.8.1   2020/04/09   pinterf      Restore AddGrain's original parameter order and the sse2 parameter (compatibility)
1.8.2   2020/05/20   pinterf      Fix SIMD code: 8/16/32 bits gave different look for the same given fixed seeds.
1.8.3   2021/03/09   pinterf      Fix: possible crash for packed RGB formats
